4. Thymeleaf is a Java XML/XHTML/HTML5 Template Engine that can work both in web (Servlet-based) and non-web environments. It is better suited for serving XHTML/HTML5 at the view    layer of MVC-based web applications, but it can process any XML file even in offline environments. It provides full Spring Framework integration. The template file of Thymeleaf    in essence are only a ordinary document file with the format of XML/XHTML/HTML5. Thymeleaf Engine will read a template file and combine with Java objects to generate another      document.
5. FreeMarker is a Template Engine. it is provided by Apache as an open source Java library. The FreeMarker reads sample files and combines them with Java objects to generate an       output text (html, email, ..). 
    The Template files of the FreeMarker in nature, are only a text file in the format introduced by the FreeMarker, which is FreeMarker Template Language (FTL).
